\title{Classes and methods for working with spectral (electromagnetic) data in R.}
\description{
\pkg{geoSpectral} is an R package providing a new data type for R that stores
 spectral, temporal, and spatial attributes of measurement data as well as methods for 
accessing and manipulating the spectral (and non-spectral) data
with code.
}
\details{
This package provides the following S4 classes: 
\itemize{
  \item \code{Spectra} (stores spatial/temporal/spectral aspects of data)
  \item \code{SpcHeader} (stores metadata in an R list object)
  \item \code{SpcList} (makes a collection of Spectra objects in an R list)
}
as well as basic data access and manipulation methods for importing, acessing and
subsetting, converting into R objects, analyzing, plotting, and exporting to other scientific
data formats. Have a look at the constructor function by typing \code{?Spectra} to get started.
