\title{Plotting \code{SpcList} object in a grid}
\usage{
spc.plot.grid(x,FUN, nnrow, nncol, mar=c(4,4.5,1,0.5),oma = c(0,0,0,0), lab_cex, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{SpcList} data}

\item{FUN}{a character string giving the name of the ploting function to be used. 
Can be either of "spc.plot"}

\item{...}{any further arguments of plot}

\item{mar}{A numeric vector of length 4, which sets the margin sizes in the following order: bottom, left, top, and right. The default is c(4,4.5,1,0.5)}

\item{lab_cex}{vector of character expansion sizes, used cyclically}

\item{nrow}{number of row for grid}

\item{ncol}{number of column for grid}

\item{oma}{oma the "outer margin area" around a figure or figures. The usage of mar and oma is shown when plotting a single figure,}
