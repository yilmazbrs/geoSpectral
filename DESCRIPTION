Description: This package provides S4 classes and basic manipulation methods
    for datasets frequently used in remote sensing, bio-optical oceanography and
    environmental and earth sciences. The package is based on the data type called
    Spectra which extends the STIDF class of package spacetime. Spatial/temporal and
    spectral aspects of Bio-Optical data that are regularly collected during Bio-
    Optical oceanography campaigns can be easily represented with the Spectra class.
